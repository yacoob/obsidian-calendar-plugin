# Event Calendar wrapper for Obsidian

This is an exploratory plugin that wraps https://fullcalendar.io for usage in Obsidian. Very much work in progress, not for public consumption etc.

## next

- finish basic calendar usable via dataviewjs block
- register a custom view
- render basic calendar in that view
- start using it in the main vault to assess the speed

## notes

- datacore lacks equivalents of `dv.paragraph()` and similar as of April 2025 which in turn strongly suggests constructing my own react component. I got it working, but I'm unsure as to [how brittle](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/datacore/issues/103) that approach is

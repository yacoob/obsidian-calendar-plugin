# Event Calendar wrapper for Obsidian

This is an exploratory plugin that wraps https://fullcalendar.io for usage in Obsidian. Very much work in progress, not for public consumption etc.

## next

- parse a bunch of existing tasks
- verify whether tasks get updated on the calendar after edit, consider using [eventSources](https://github.com/vkurko/calendar?tab=readme-ov-file#eventsources)
- start using it with +/-1y worth of loaded data
- look at svelte options for making the task list dynamic

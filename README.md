# Event Calendar wrapper for Obsidian

This is an exploratory plugin that wraps https://fullcalendar.io for usage in Obsidian. Very much work in progress, not for public consumption etc.

## next

- use datacore's [api](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/datacore/blob/a4324f62b392db2e071c34f4c6b73abe3cf370f3/src/api/api.ts) from this plugin
- convert a bunch of existing tasks for the current month out of a `dc.query` result
- write an [event source](https://fullcalendar.io/docs/events-function) glue function for fullcalendar
- start using it with the current dataset to assess the speed
